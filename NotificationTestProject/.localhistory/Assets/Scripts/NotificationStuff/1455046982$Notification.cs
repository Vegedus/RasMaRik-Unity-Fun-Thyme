I've created custom buttons in Unity's UI and have added my own UnityEvents to these buttons so that I can assign functions to call on click events and such.I'm doing this with:
public class ToggleEvent : UnityEvent<bool> { }

[SerializeField]
public ToggleEvent clickEvent;
With the event calls looking simply like:
public void ButtonEvent(bool value) { }
This works great in the editor but when I call
clickEvent.Invoke(true);
...it'll only pass whatever the bool value is marked off in the editor, not what's actually being passed.How do I override what's being set in the editor and pass my own variables in code?
               clickEvent.AddListener(ButtonEvent);
clickEvent.Invoke(true);
